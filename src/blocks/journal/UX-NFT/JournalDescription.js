      <h5 style={{ color: "black" }}>3. Empthazing and Research</h5>
      <p>
        Before moving father , let us know about NTF Marketplace ,<br />
        <br />
        NFT(non-fungible token) It is a special kind of digital asset that
        cannot be traded one for one for standard currencies or commodities.
        Each NFT is unique because it has a unique digital signature that is
        kept on a blockchain, a decentralised digital ledger. Digital art,
        music, films, and other forms of internet content are among the many
        uses of NFTs. They are being used to sell and verify digital artwork and
        valuables.
        <br />
        <br />
        To conduct NFT UX research, conducted a series of user interviews and
        usability tests with a group of NFT collectors and enthusiasts. asked
        participants about their experiences buying, selling, and trading NFTs,
        as well as their expectations for a new NFT marketplace platform. <br />
        <br />
        Based on the feedback they receive from participants, I identified
        several key pain points and areas for improvement.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>The following are some pain points :</strong>
      </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <span style={{ fontWeight: 900, textDecorationLine: "underline" }}>
              Poor navigation and organization:
            </span>{" "}
            Certain NFT markets might be difficult to navigate because of the
            abundance of material. Users may struggle to access the information
            they need due to inadequate navigation and structure, which can
            cause irritation and a bad user experience.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span style={{ fontWeight: 900, textDecorationLine: "underline" }}>
              Lack of filtering options:
            </span>{" "}
            Some markets donâ€™t offer adequate filtering options, which may be
            important to users who wish to sort NFTs by certain factors like
            price, artist, or topic. Users may find it difficult and
            time-consuming to locate NFTs that are suitable for their unique
            requirements as a result.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span style={{ fontWeight: 900, textDecorationLine: "underline" }}>
              Confusing Purchasing processes:
            </span>{" "}
            The process of buying an NFT can be complex and confusing for users
            who are unfamiliar with cryptocurrency wallets and transactions.
            Poorly designed purchase processes can lead to errors,
            misunderstandings, and a poor user experience.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span style={{ fontWeight: 900, textDecorationLine: "underline" }}>
              Poorly designed user interfaces:
            </span>
            NFT marketplaces with poorly designed user interfaces can be
            frustrating to use. This may include confusing layouts, inconsistent
            button placements, or unclear instructions.
